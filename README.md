# Ecochange Tutorial

This repository contains my work with the **ecochange** R package, developed as part of my internship project.  
The goal is to explore ecosystem change analysis by following the official ecochange tutorial and documenting the process in R Markdown.

## Contents
- `ecochange_tutorial.Rmd` â†’ the main R Markdown file with code, explanations, and analysis  
- Additional data or figures generated during the tutorial  

## What I did
- Installed and explored the **ecochange** package  
- Downloaded and processed environmental datasets (e.g., Global Forest Change, Global Surface Water, MODIS vegetation indices)  
- Used functions such as:
  - `getGADM()` â†’ to obtain administrative units  
  - `listGP()` â†’ to list available environmental datasets  
  - `getrsp()` â†’ to download specific layers (e.g., water occurrence)  
  - `echanges()` â†’ to represent ecosystem changes  
  - `sampleIndicator()` â†’ to compute biodiversity indicators on grid cells  
- Produced plots and visual outputs included in the R Markdown/HTML report  

## Purpose
The repository serves as a record of my progress in learning and applying the **ecochange** package.  
It will also be the starting point for further analysis during my internship.  

## How to use
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio  
3. Run the code chunks step by step, or knit the file to reproduce the results
